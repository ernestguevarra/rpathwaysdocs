Description: Results pathways are usually based on a theory of change describing
    how change is assumed to come about through intervention/s in a prevailing
    situation. The theory is laid out in a diagram showing the connections
    between interventions and outcomes - the results pathways. This package
    contains text datasets of various documents describing current thinking
    on the use of results pathways for monitoring and evaluations various
    projects.
